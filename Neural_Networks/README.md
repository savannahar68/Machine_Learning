# Deep Learning using Neural Networks and Tensorflow

Dependencies:<br/>
sudo pip install tensorflow<br/>
sudo pip3 install tensorflow<br/>

So Tensorflow is special library which does heavy computation related things maintaining a Graph in Session.
Using tensorFlow we'll built our Neural Network.

#Mnist NN
1.First we'll create a small Neural network for mnist dataset.It is a small dataset around 12mb and best example to learn NN and also the dataset is also in well format so we dont have to worry for now about cleaning it.Mnist set has 60000 images from 0-9 and has 10000 testing images.

So we'll take all the test images pass it through NN, NN will learn it and then we'll test it.Here each of the pixel is a feature value
