In this part we'll learn classification, which is basically grouping of data points.<br/>
Whenever we have scattered data points into clusters(groups) we can recognize it using naked eye <br/>
Similarly we can use Machine learning to determine to which cluster the new point should go.

1.K Nearest Neighbours - 
	In K Nearest Neighbours we ususally take k as odd number(To solve the conflict which take place when we get same cluster number for a point) and then find K closest point to the new point , now according to majority we put the point in that particular cluster.
