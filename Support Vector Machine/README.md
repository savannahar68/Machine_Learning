In support vector machine we try to draw a like which in its best way will divide the dataset without partiality<br/>
The line will be drawn on the distance from each point and then the best fitting line would be chosen <br/>
For prediction whatever to the left of the line falls into that subgroup similarly for right side of line <br/>

There are types of Kernel each supporting a different category,
1.Linear
2.RBF
3.Polynomial
