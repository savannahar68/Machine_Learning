In support vector machine we try to draw a like which in its best way will divide the dataset without partiality<br/>
The line will be drawn on the distance from each point and then the best fitting line would be chosen <br/>
For prediction whatever to the left of the line falls into that subgroup similarly for right side of line <br/>


There are types of Kernel each supporting a different category <br/>
1.Linear<br/>
2.RBF<br/>
3.Polynomial<br/>
