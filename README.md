# Machine_Learning
Implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and project step by step/Day by Day.</br>
Target is to go through the basics of ML and DL and then doing projects in this field.</br>
For Machine Learning data we can use this site https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html ,lots of categorized data is available ,more we test the better our model will be <br/>
Datasets can also be collected from Kaggle,UCI,MyGov Dataset etc.If you don't have High end laptop with 8+ Gigs of Ram and 2+ Gigs of GPU then you can run your model on https://colab.research.google.com which is completely free, and also on AWS for students which is free for 1 year. <br/><br/>
