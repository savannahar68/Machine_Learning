# Machine_Learning
Implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and project step by step/Day by Day.</br>
Target is to go through the basics of ML and DL and then doing projects in this field.</br>
For Machine Learning data we can use this site https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html ,lots of categorized data is available ,more we test the better our model will be
[1.Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/savannahar68/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Simple_Linear_Regr)
[2.Classification](https://github.com/savannahar68/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Classification)
